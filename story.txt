Joe was the best. The fastest, strongest, and smartest in the ring. When Joe stepped between the ropes and into the center of the ring, Joe owned it. It was his domain, his territory, and Joe defended it with his life. When the bell rang, he had one mission. He was like a robot set on destroy all. Each action was calculated seconds before it happened. Joe could see what his opponent was going to do before he did it. He could see when to adjust, and counter his opponent's move. He moved around the ring with great ease, almost like he was gliding. He could get from one side of the ring to the other in a few quick steps. He was so fast. Then there were his hits, even faster than his feet. He could knock guys down in one swift, well placed punch. Theyâ€™d be on the floor before they could even see it coming.
Joe was the fiercest man to ever step in the ring, until someone came to rival his prowess. Ben Harrison was a shining star in the underground boxing scene. He was known by everyone as the strongest man of Delaware. After constantly being told that he was good enough to become a professional, he soon set his eyes on rising to the top in the professional boxing scene, in hopes of being able to fight Joe, the best boxer in the world.
